In a SaaS product, the equivalent process would involve using Grok 3 to generate a detailed product requirement document from a business idea, outlining features, user flows, and technical needs.
Grok 3 would recommend the optimal tech stack—frontend, backend, and cloud infrastructure—based on the SaaS product’s scalability goals, such as handling thousands of users or real-time data processing.
Grok 3 would break the requirement document into an implementation plan with clear, incremental steps, starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) and iterating for major upgrades like new integrations or performance optimizations.
Cursor, configured with .cursorrules based on Grok’s stack recommendations, would guide development, such as optimizing for mobile responsiveness or API scalability.
Cursor, paired with Sonnet 3.7, would study the requirement document and implementation plan, asking 9-10 clarifying questions to ensure alignment before coding begins—responses would refine the plan in the implementation file.
Sonnet 3.7 would execute Phase 1 (e.g., building a core feature like user authentication), after which you, as the QA, would test it; if successful, Sonnet would document the work in a new chat for each phase.
For Phase 2 (e.g., adding payment processing), Sonnet would review prior work and the requirement document, you’d test again, and the process repeats, ensuring iterative progress.
If testing fails, you’d prompt Sonnet or Claude with specific adjustments to fix issues, using detailed instructions to debug or refine code.
If stuck, Grok 3 would analyze your GitHub repo to craft a targeted prompt for Claude, helping resolve complex blockers.
For severe roadblocks, you’d revert to previous commits or prompts, experimenting with alternatives, or identify problematic files (e.g., API endpoints, database schemas) to investigate with Sonnet’s “Thinking” mode.
For SaaS products exceeding 20,000 lines of code, Sonnet would create an architecture.md file to map the system’s structure, aiding all future prompts and scaling efforts.
With over 3,000 prompts in Cursor, you’d dynamically switch between Sonnet 3.5, 4o, and 4.5 based on model strengths, such as using 4.5 for refining user-facing messaging, fully leveraging AI to build the SaaS product autonomously.
