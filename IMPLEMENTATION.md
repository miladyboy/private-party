Implementation Plan for PartyStream (MVP and Iterations)

1. Overview
   This implementation plan breaks down the PartyStream PRD into manageable phases, starting with an MVP that delivers core functionality to validate the concept. Each phase includes clear, small steps, with testing and documentation after completion. Major upgrades (e.g., new integrations, performance optimizations) will follow as separate iterations, building on the MVP.
   Goal: Launch a functional MVP within 4–6 weeks, then iterate based on user feedback and scaling needs.

2. MVP (Phase 1) – Core Private Digital Party Functionality
   Objective: Build a basic version of PartyStream that allows one DJ and one host to connect for a private, low-latency streaming party, with payment integration and minimal UI.
   Steps:
   Setup Environment:
   Install and configure development tools: Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Supabase, and AWS SDK for Amazon IVS.
   Create a GitHub repository for version control and initialize with basic project structure (frontend, backend, database).
   Use Cursor with .cursorrules to enforce React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and Supabase (database) as the stack, optimized for web performance.
   Backend Development:
   Set up a Node.js/Express server with basic API endpoints:
   User/DJ registration and authentication (JWT-based).
   DJ profile creation (availability, pricing, external video links).
   Booking system for hosts to schedule private parties.
   Integrate Supabase for storing user/DJ profiles, schedules, and bookings (simple schema: users, djs, bookings tables).
   Implement Stripe integration for payment processing (basic transaction for DJ bookings, platform takes a percentage).
   Frontend Development:
   Build a React.js web interface with a clean, minimalist design:
   DJ profile page (view availability, pricing, external links).
   Host dashboard (search DJs, book a party, view booking status).
   Simple streaming page (display Amazon IVS stream, basic chat).
   Ensure responsive design for desktop and tablet (mobile optimization deferred to a later phase).
   Streaming Integration:
   Integrate Amazon IVS for real-time streaming (sub-300ms latency).
   Set up a basic streaming workflow: DJ initiates stream via Amazon IVS, host joins via a unique link.
   Implement minimal interactivity (real-time chat using WebSocket/Socket.io).
   Testing (QA by You):
   Test end-to-end flow: DJ creates profile, host books DJ, stream starts, payment processes.
   Verify sub-300ms latency for streaming, <2-second page load times, and secure transactions.
   Document any bugs or issues in a bugs.md file in the GitHub repo.
   Documentation:
   Use Sonnet 3.7 in a new Cursor chat to document Phase 1: code structure, API endpoints, and user flows.
   Export documentation to a phase1_implementation.md file in the repo.
   Deliverable: A functional MVP where one DJ and one host can complete a private party with low-latency streaming, booking, and payment.
   Timeline: 4–6 weeks (depending on complexity and testing).

3. Iteration 1 – Performance Optimization and Scalability
   Objective: Optimize the MVP for better performance and prepare for scaling to handle more users and parties.
   Steps:
   Analyze Performance:
   Use Grok 3 to analyze the GitHub repo and identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., server load, streaming latency, database queries).
   Generate a prompt for Sonnet 3.7 to optimize Node.js/Express backend and React frontend (e.g., caching, lazy loading, database indexing in Supabase).
   Implement Optimizations:
   Reduce server load with AWS auto-scaling and load balancing.
   Optimize Supabase queries for faster data retrieval (e.g., indexing bookings, user profiles).
   Ensure Amazon IVS streaming remains sub-300ms under higher loads (test with simulated 100 concurrent viewers).
   Testing (QA by You):
   Test performance under load (e.g., 50–100 simulated users per party).
   Verify no degradation in latency, UI responsiveness, or payment processing.
   Document issues in bugs.md and fix via prompts to Sonnet 3.7.
   Documentation:
   Use Sonnet 3.7 in a new Cursor chat to document optimizations (e.g., code changes, performance metrics).
   Update architecture.md (if >20k LOC) or create it if needed, mapping backend, frontend, and infrastructure.
   Deliverable: A scalable, optimized version of PartyStream supporting up to 100 concurrent viewers per party reliably.
   Timeline: 2–4 weeks after MVP launch.

4. Iteration 2 – Multi-DJ and Multi-Host Support
   Objective: Expand the platform to support multiple DJs and hosts per party, enhancing interactivity and scalability.
   Steps:
   Update Requirements:
   Revise the PRD to include multi-DJ support (e.g., co-hosting parties) and multi-host support (e.g., 5–10 viewers per party).
   Use Grok 3 to generate an updated implementation plan for these features.
   Backend Development:
   Modify Supabase schema to support multiple DJs per booking and multiple hosts/viewers per stream.
   Enhance API endpoints for managing multi-party dynamics (e.g., DJ coordination, viewer permissions).
   Frontend Development:
   Update React UI to handle multiple DJ profiles, booking workflows, and viewer interfaces.
   Add features like viewer chat moderation and DJ collaboration tools.
   Streaming Integration:
   Upgrade Amazon IVS to handle multiple streams and viewers (e.g., multi-camera streaming, larger audience capacity).
   Ensure sub-300ms latency for all participants.
   Testing (QA by You):
   Test multi-DJ and multi-host workflows, ensuring no latency or performance issues.
   Verify payment scaling for multiple bookings and viewers.
   Documentation:
   Use Sonnet 3.7 in a new Cursor chat to document changes, focusing on scalability and new features.
   Update architecture.md or phase2_implementation.md as needed.
   Deliverable: A platform supporting multiple DJs and 5–10 hosts/viewers per private party with robust performance.
   Timeline: 4–6 weeks after Iteration 1.

5. Iteration 3 – Mobile Optimization and Localization
