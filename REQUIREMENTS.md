1. Product Overview
   Product Name: PartyStream
   Description: PartyStream is a web-based platform that enables users to organize private digital parties by hiring DJs for real-time, low-latency streaming events.

It targets a mix of individual users and businesses, primarily younger demographics, with plans for future expansion to other entertainers.
   Mission: To create an engaging, easy-to-use platform for private digital parties, leveraging AI and low-latency streaming to deliver seamless, high-quality experiences.

2. Target Audience
   Primary Users:
   Individuals (e.g., young adults hosting birthdays, anniversaries, or casual gatherings).
   Businesses (e.g., corporate events, promotional parties for younger audiences).
   Demographics: Mostly younger people (18–35 years old), tech-savvy, interested in music and digital entertainment.
   Geographic Focus: Initially global, with English as the primary language, but designed for easy localization.

3. Key Features
   3.1 DJ Features
   Profile Creation: DJs create profiles with:
   Availability (schedulable hours, with ability to block out unavailable times).
   Pricing (hourly or per-event rates).
   Additional Information: Music genres, experience, reviews/ratings, equipment, languages spoken.
   Links to external platforms (e.g., YouTube, SoundCloud) for video samples (no music uploads allowed on the platform).
   Scheduling: Manual or automated scheduling system allowing DJs to set and manage availability, block times, and confirm bookings.

   Platform takes a percentage of all paid events as revenue.
   3.3 Streaming Features
   Real-Time Streaming:
   Utilizes Amazon IVS (Interactive Video Service) for low-latency streaming (sub-300ms latency).
   Supports audio and video of the DJ, with potential for additional visual elements (e.g., virtual party themes, animations).
   Handles up to 100 concurrent viewers per party initially (scalable based on demand).
   Interactivity:
   Real-time chat for host-DJ interaction.
   Audience engagement tools (e.g., polls, song requests) via Amazon IVS timed metadata.

4. User Flows
   4.1 DJ Onboarding
   DJ registers on PartyStream with email and creates a profile.
   DJ enters availability, pricing, and additional details (genres, experience, external video links).
   DJ manages schedule, blocks unavailable times, and receives booking requests.
   4.2 Host Booking Process
   Host logs in, searches for DJs by criteria (genre, price, availability).
   Host selects a DJ, checks availability, and books a private party for a specific date/time.
   Host pays via Stripe, receives a unique link for the private stream.
   During the event, host interacts with the DJ via real-time streaming and chat features.
   4.3 Party Experience
   DJ starts the stream using Amazon IVS, delivering low-latency audio/video (sub-300ms latency).
   Host joins the private stream, interacts with the DJ (chat, song requests), and manages any invited guests (single host/viewer initially).
   Event concludes, and both parties can leave reviews/ratings.

5. Technical Requirements
   5.1 Frontend
   Technology: React.js for a responsive, interactive web interface.
   Features:
   Clean, minimalist UI with party-themed visuals.
   Real-time updates for DJ availability, booking status, and streaming.
   Localization support (multi-language, currency formatting).
   5.2 Backend
   Technology: Node.js with Express.js for scalable, high-performance server-side logic.
   Features:
   User/DJ authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT for secure sessions).
   Database for profiles, schedules, bookings, and payments (e.g., Supabase for cloud database management).
   API integration with Stripe for payments.
   Real-time communication (e.g., WebSocket or Socket.io for chat features).
   Integration with Amazon IVS for low-latency streaming (sub-300ms latency).
   5.3 Infrastructure
   Cloud Hosting: AWS (Amazon Web Services) for scalability and reliability.
   Amazon IVS for real-time streaming (sub-300ms latency).
   AWS EC2 or Lambda for backend hosting, S3 for static assets, and Supabase for database management.
   Scalability: Design for global reach, initially supporting 100 concurrent viewers per party, with plans to scale for higher demand.
   5.4 Performance
   Ensure sub-300ms latency for streaming using Amazon IVS.
   Optimize for low server load during peak party times (e.g., caching, load balancing).
   5.5 Security
   Encrypt user data (e.g., TLS/SSL for communications, hashed passwords).
   Comply with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for user and DJ information.
   Secure payment processing via Stripe’s PCI-compliant infrastructure.
   5.6 Music Licensing
   Ensure DJs comply with music licensing for streamed content (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, or platform-specific licenses for Amazon IVS).

6. Non-Functional Requirements
   Usability: Intuitive, minimalistic interface for both DJs and hosts.
   Performance: Sub-300ms latency for streaming, <2-second page load times for key interactions.
   Scalability: Support for global users, with initial capacity for 100 viewers per party, scalable to thousands.
   Reliability: 99.9% uptime for the platform and streaming services.
   Security: Protect against DDoS attacks, data breaches, and ensure PCI compliance for payments.

7. Future Growth
   Expansion:
   Add other entertainers (e.g., bands, comedians, virtual performers) with similar profile and booking workflows.
   Introduce advanced features like virtual party games, AR/VR experiences, or AI-driven recommendations for entertainers.
   Monetization: Explore premium features (e.g., enhanced streaming quality) or advertising for larger events.

8. Risks and Mitigations
   Risk: Music licensing issues for DJs.
   Mitigation: Require DJs to provide proof of licensing or use platform-integrated licensing solutions.
